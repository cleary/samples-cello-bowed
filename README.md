Bowed cello samples by [Trevor Exter](https://trevorexter.bandcamp.com/) - tuned to C with various attacks, styles, releases and octaves

These were developed with the intent to use in tidalcycles, I strongly recommend checking out to an existing samples folder sourced by supercollider as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/cleary/samples-cello-bowed.git /path/to/samples-folder/cbow
```

then restart supercollider/load the new samples

## extra info

- Normalised to -1.0db (mostly)
